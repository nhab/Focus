# Focus.js
Focus.js is a replacement for CSS in html. 

It is series of JavaScript functions that  are using DOM to manipulate html element color, position, dimension and more.

Traditional web developement needs more than 3 programming skill to write a single website:html,javascript and css (+ many libraries/frameworks).

The easier aproach is to focus on javascript which is more capable and more easer.

Js is able to produce and manupulate the html elements Using it's DOM Class.

In this way your efforts will be more effective. Focus.js is the answer for such a need.

Focus.js is framework for make coding and debuging the web development much easier ,by **focusing on one skill** instead of 3.

It **generates Html DOM elements dynamically on the fly**. So you even do't need to have any html code!

  - :eyes: Minimum learning curve and easy to use.
  - :cloud: Lightweight.
  - :repeat: Extensibilty: Base Objects are in focusBase.js but you can make Compositeobjects on top of it.
  
## key concept
when you use Focus.js functions,It **generates Html elements dynamically on the fly**.

For example when you write:
```javascript
  Focus.Layout.radioBoxes(document.body,"Choose one: ",["Conventinal","none-conventional"]);
```

it generates these code dynamically on the fly :
```html
<div>
  <p> Type </p>
  <input  name='rb1' type='radio'  />Conventinal</input>
  <input  name='rb2' type='radio'  />none-Conventinal</input>
</div>
```
