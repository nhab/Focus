# Focus.js
Traditional web developement aproach needs more than 3 programming skill to write a single website:html,javascript
and css ,plus thousands of libraries/frameworks.
the easier aproach is to focus on javascript which is able to produce the html dom elements and css.

Focus.js is framework for make coding and debuging the web development much easier ,by **focusing on one skill** instead of 3 skills.

It **generates Html DOM elements dynamically on the fly**.

## key concept
when you use Focus.js functions,It **generates Html elements dynamically on the fly**.

For example when you write:
```javascript
  radioBoxes(document.body,"Type",["Conventinal","none-conventional"]);
```

it generates these code dynamically on the fly :
```html
<div>
  <p> Type </p>
  <input  name='rb1' type='radio'  />Conventinal</input>
  <input  name='rb2' type='radio'  />none-Conventinal</input>
</div>
```
